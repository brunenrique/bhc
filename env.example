# For FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY, when copying from the JSON file:
# 1. Copy the entire string including "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----" and "-----END PRIVATE KEY-----".
# 2. Replace all literal newline characters (\n) within the key with the actual newline character.
#    In a .env file, you can often represent newlines by enclosing the key in double quotes.
#    Example for .env.local:
#    FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvA...your...key...here...\n...rest...of...key...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

# For local development, this tells the client-side Firebase SDK where to connect.
